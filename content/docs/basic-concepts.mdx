# Basic Concepts

Understanding the core concepts of Flodoc will help you create better documentation.

## Documents

Each document in Flodoc is written in MDX format. MDX allows you to:

- Write standard Markdown content
- Import and use React components
- Include interactive examples
- Add custom styling

## Frontmatter

Every document includes frontmatter metadata:

```yaml
---
title: Your Document Title
description: Brief description
slug: url-friendly-slug
tags: [category1, category2]
connections:
  - type: next
    target: next-document-slug
---
```

## Connection Types

Flodoc supports several types of document connections:

- **prerequisite**: Documents that should be read first
- **next**: The logical next document to read
- **related**: Documents on related topics
- **seealso**: Additional resources

## Visualization

All these connections are visualized in the Flow Graph, making it easy to:

- Understand documentation structure
- Find related content
- Navigate learning paths
- Identify gaps in documentation
