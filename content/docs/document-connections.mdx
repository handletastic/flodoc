# Document Connections

Document connections are the heart of Flodoc's visual documentation system.

## Connection Types

### Prerequisite

Use for documents that should be read before the current document:

```yaml
connections:
  - type: prerequisite
    target: foundational-document
```

### Next

Suggest the logical next document in a learning path:

```yaml
connections:
  - type: next
    target: next-step-document
```

### Related

Link to documents on related topics:

```yaml
connections:
  - type: related
    target: related-topic
```

### See Also

Reference additional resources:

```yaml
connections:
  - type: seealso
    target: supplementary-material
```

## Visualizing Connections

All connections appear in the Flow Graph view, where you can:

- See the entire documentation structure
- Navigate between connected documents
- Identify learning paths
- Find related content quickly

## Connection Strategy

When planning connections:

1. **Start with prerequisites** - What should readers know first?
2. **Define clear next steps** - Where should they go next?
3. **Add related content** - What else might be relevant?
4. **Include additional resources** - What might be helpful?

## Graph Views

The Flow Graph supports different visualization modes:

- **Knowledge Graph**: Shows all bidirectional relationships
- **Navigation Tree**: Displays hierarchical structure
- **Learning Path**: Highlights sequential progression
