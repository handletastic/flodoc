# Getting Started with Flodoc

Welcome to Flodoc! This guide will help you get started with creating interconnected documentation.

## What is Flodoc?

Flodoc is a documentation application that uses react-flow to visualize connections between documents. It combines the power of:

- **MDX** for rich, component-based documentation
- **React Flow** for visual document relationships
- **TanStack Router** for seamless navigation
- **Git** for version control and collaboration

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const message = greet('World');
console.log(message);
```

## Installation

Install Flodoc with your package manager:

```bash filename="terminal"
npm install flodoc
# or
bun install flodoc
```

## Key Features

- 📝 Write documentation in MDX format
- 🔗 Define relationships between documents
- 📊 Visualize documentation structure as a graph
- 🎨 Rich components and interactive examples
- 🌙 Dark mode support
- 📱 Responsive design

## Creating Your First Document

Create a new MDX file with frontmatter:

```markdown filename="docs/my-first-doc.mdx" highlightLines="1-5"
---
title: My First Document
description: Getting started with Flodoc
slug: my-first-doc
---

# My First Document

Welcome to your first Flodoc document!
```

## TypeScript Support

Flodoc has full TypeScript support:

```typescript filename="types.ts" highlightLines="2-4"
interface DocumentMetadata {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  slug: string;
  tags?: string[];
}

function loadDocument(slug: string): DocumentMetadata {
  // Implementation here
}
```
