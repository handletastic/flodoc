# Creating Documents

Learn how to create effective documentation with Flodoc.

## Creating a New Document

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the `content/docs/` directory
2. Add frontmatter metadata
3. Write your content using Markdown and MDX
4. Define connections to other documents

## Example Document

slug: my-new-document
tags: [guide]
connections:
  - type: next
    target: another-document

# My New Document

Your content here...
```

## Best Practices

### Clear Titles

Use descriptive titles that clearly indicate the document's purpose.

### Useful Descriptions

Write concise descriptions for search and navigation.

### Meaningful Slugs

Create URL-friendly slugs that are easy to remember and share.

### Relevant Tags

Tag documents with relevant categories for better organization.

### Logical Connections

Connect documents in a way that guides readers through your content.

## Using Components

You can import and use React components in your MDX:

```mdx
import { Alert } from '@/components/alert'

<Alert variant="info">
  This is an informational alert!
</Alert>
```
