- Feature branches should be short lived and merged as soon as the implementation, testing is complete. We shouldn't have branches that are feature complete hanging. A draft PR should be created for each feature branch on creation, we should document information on the draft PR during development for better assessment and review, and upon the feature being completly implemented and tested, the draft PR should be promoted to a normal PR and update the PR information for accurate reflection of the works done and purpose, reasoning in decision making as well. The PR should be reviewed by a subagent and when approved the merge should be done. Effectively removing hanging PRs and long lived feature branches.
